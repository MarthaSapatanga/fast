	Abstract = {The FAST environment [1] allows users to graphically compose intelligent, i.e. semantically annotated gadgets from predefined building blocks and deploy them on various mashup platforms, thus enabling the interconnection of different systems and services. Since different parties involved in the creation of gadgets and building blocks conceptualise knowledge in different ontologies, using ontology matching as a means to reconcile differences in the various conceptualisations is a crucial issue. This paper discusses first steps in our effort to integrate ontology matching in an end-user-oriented environment such as FAST, using an e-commerce-related scenario. We evaluate a number of tools and approaches for solving different levels of complexity in ontology matching and define the direction of integrating ontology matching into the FAST environment.},

@article{moeller2009ontology_soft_skills,
	Abstract = {In this paper we argue for the importance of soft ontology factors, or ``ontology soft skills'' as an important aspect for the quality of an ontology. Ontology soft skills are those features of an ontology which relate less to technical and structural issues, but rather to how well an ontology manages to attract new users and implementers and how well it manages to achieve adoption and uptake. We present a set of five guidelines for good ontology soft skills and illustrate them with concrete examples from the Semantic Web Conference Ontology (SWC). We argue that greater adoption and uptake mean greater sharedness, and therefore ultimately a more ``beautiful'' ontology.},

	Abstract = {The FOAF project is based around the use of machine readable Web homepages for people, groups, companies and other kinds of thing. To achieve this we use the "FOAF vocabulary" to provide a collection of basic terms that can be used in these Web pages. At the heart of the FOAF project is a set of  definitions designed to serve as a dictionary  of terms that can be used to express claims about the world. The initial  focus of FOAF has been on the description of people, since people are the things that link together most of the other kinds of things we describe in the Web: they make documents, attend meetings, are depicted in photos, and so on. 
The FOAF Vocabulary definitions presented here are written using a computer language (RDF/OWL) that makes it easy for software to process some basic facts about the terms in the FOAF vocabulary, and consequently about the things described in FOAF documents. A FOAF document, unlike a traditional Web page, can be combined with other FOAF documents to create a unified database of information. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents the suite of principles, designs criteria  and verification process used in the knowledge conceptualization process of a consensuated domain ontology in the domain of chemicals. To achieve agreement between different development teams we propose the use of a common and shared conceptual model as starting point. To capture domain knowledge of a given domain and organize it in a shared and consensuated conceptual model, we recommend an approach that integrates the following intermediate representation techniques: Data Dictionary, Concepts Classification Trees, Tables of Instance Attributes, Table of Class Attributes, Table of Constants, Tables of Formulas, Attributes Classification Trees, and Tables of Instances.  We also provide a set of guidelines to verify the knowledge gathered inside each intermediate representations and between intermediate representations.},
	Annote = {This paper is a precursor to the Methontology paper from 1997. Using the domain of chemistry as an example throughout the paper, the authors present an approach for ontology engineering/modelling. They propose a four step approach, consisting of (i) an informal knowledge capturing step, (ii) a conceptualisation step where different aspects of the ontology such as classes, attributes, instances, etc. are captured in the form of specificly defined tables and graphs, (iii) a materialisation step in which the ontology is expressed in a formal ontology language. The fourth step (iv) is evaluation, which is taking place during and in between each of the other steps.
The different tables and figures which are generated in step (ii) are a data dictionary (all concepts, instances, attributes and values), a concept classification tree, a table of constants, a table of instance attributes, a table of class attributes, a table of formulas, an attribute classification tree and a table of instances.
For the instances, surely the auhors do not have in mind to list _all_ possible instances of a class. Imagine trying to do that for foaf:Person. But maybe such scenarios weren't even taken into account.},

@inproceedings{fernandez1997methontology,
	Abstract = {This paper does not pretend either to transform completely the ontological art in engineering or to enumerate exhaustively the complete set of works that has been reported in this area. Its goal is to clarify to readers interested in building ontologies from scratch, the activities they should perform and in which order, as well as the set of techniques to be used in each phase of the methodology. This paper only presents a set of activities that conform the ontology development process, a life cycle to build ontologies based in evolving prototypes, and METHONTOLOGY, a well-structured methodology used to build ontologies from scratch. This paper gathers the experience of the authors on building an ontology in the domain of chemicals.},
	Annote = {This paper introduces the METHONTOLOGY methodology for ontology design. One of the main incentives for having such a methodology is the nicely summarised by the following quote:

"So, the art [of ontology design] will became [SIC] engineering when there exist a definition and standardization of a life cycle that goes [SIC] from requirements definition to maintenance of the finished product, as well as methodologies and techniques that drive their development."

The authors have introduce their approach in three stages: They list all the activities that they deem necessary in the process of ontology engineering, they arrange those activities in a lifecycle model and they specify how each activity should be carried out in the form olf their methodology.

The activities are: planning (the say "planification", which doesn't sound like real English), specifying a requirements document, conceptualising the domain in a set of intermediate representations (\cite{gomez_perez1996conceptualise_ontologies}), formalising the ontology into a formal model, integrating the ontology with other ontologies, implementing the ontology in a formal language, evaluating the ontology, documenting the ontology and maintaining the ontology.

In their lifecycle model, some activities are carried out sequentially, while others take place throughout the whole engineering process. The authors also specify three models of lifecycles, which have an impact on how sequential the arrangement of the activities really is. According to the strictest model, each activity must finish completely in order for the next to begin (waterfall lifecycle). According to the incremental lifecycle (using McCracken 1982 as a reference for the incremental lifecycle here is quite strange), new ontology versions allow repititions/circles in the lifecycle. The authors consider both approaches as too restrictive for ontology engineering, and instead suggest an "evolving" kind of lifecycle, which basically allows the ontology engineer to jump back and forth at will in the lifecycle, in order to accommodate a kind of organic evolution of the ontology.

In METHONTOLOGY, the authors describe in greater detail how the activities of specification, knowledge acquisition, conceptualisation, integration, implementation, evaluation and documentation should be carried out. Most of the concrete suggestions are along the same lines as already fleshed out in earlier publications (\cite{gomez_perez1996conceptualise_ontologies}). Documentation is provided because the outcome of each activity is a document.},
