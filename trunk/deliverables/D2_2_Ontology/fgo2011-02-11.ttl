            <p>
                The EU <a href="http://fast.morfeo-project.org/" alt="FAST Project">FAST Project</a> (FP7-ICT-2007-1-216048) sets out to develop
                end-user-focussed tools for building intelligent, interconnected Web gadgets. In a visual development environment, users can
                drag &amp; drop building blocks, customise them and link them together to create their own, custom-built gadget, which they can
                then deploy to a gadget platform like iGoogle or EZWeb.             
            </p>

            <p>
                Internally, each gadget and its building blocks are defined in RDF, using the terminology defined by this document: the FAST
                gadget ontology (FGO). The <a href="#overview">overview</a> section lists all classes and properties defined in the FGO. For a more
                detailed introduction to FAST (including a more extensive PDF version of the FGO documentation), its architecture, software prototypes,
                etc., we would like to direct you to the collection of 
                <a href="http://fast-fp7project.morfeo-project.org/documentation" alt="FAST Documentation">FAST Documentation</a> documents.

fgo:basic_model
    rdfs:label "The Basic Conceptual Model"@en ;
    rdfs:comment """
            <p>
                One of the main ideas of FAST is that each gadget consists of so-called <strong>screens</strong>: individual units of interaction, which
                the user of the gadgets visits one after the other. E.g., in a gadget for buying something in an online store, there could be a login screen,
                followed by a search screen, a selection screen and finally a check-out screen. Each screen has its own building blocks, such as a 
                <strong>form</strong> or a any number of <strong>operators</strong>. In order for the screens to interact with services like the
                online store, they are linked to <strong>resources</strong>, which are basically wrappers around backend web services. Several screens
                together build a so-called <strong>screenflow</strong>, which can then be packaged and deployed as the actual gadget the end user will see.
                The layering of all these basic concepts can be seen in the figure below.
            </p>
            <p class="centered"><a href="images/uml_composition.png" alt="Layering of basic FAST concepts"><img src="images/uml_composition_thumb.png" title="Layering of basic FAST concepts" class="doc_image"/></a></p>
            <p>
                The next figure looks closer at the features of individual screens. These are <strong>forms</strong>, <strong>resources</strong> and
                <strong>operators</strong>, which are all specialisations
                of the general <strong>screen_component</strong> concept. Each such screen component may or may not have an <strong>action</strong> or 
                <strong>trigger</strong> associated with them, which declaratively define their behaviour in terms of their own functionality or functionality 
                they can trigger in other building blocks.
            </p>
            <p class="centered"><a href="images/uml_screen_component.png" alt="FAST Screen Components"><img src="images/uml_screen_component_thumb.png" title="FAST Screen Components" class="doc_image"/></a></p>
            <p>
                Regarding their implementation, different kinds of building blocks in FAST can either be defined hard-coded as a piece of source code, or they 
                can be defined declaratively in the terms of the FAST ontology (using pipes, operators, etc.). In the former case, a building block such as a 
                screen would have been implemented and added to the FAST platform by an engineer, whereas in the latter case, ordinary users of the FAST platform 
                would have assembled the building block using the tools available in the GVS. This principle is reflected in the figure below, showing how certain 
                kinds of building blocks aggregate either a <strong>Definition</strong> or <strong>Code</strong>, whereas other kinds of building blocks are always 
                hard-coded. It should be noted that, in theory, there is no reason why not any kind of building block could be defined either way. However, the 
                concrete set of building blocks which can be defined declaratively or in code is changing dynamically according to the current state and plans of 
                the FAST project.
            </p>
            <p class="centered"><a href="images/uml_definition.png" alt="Defining Screens in FAST"><img src="images/uml_definition.png" title="Defining Screens in FAST" class="doc_image"/></a></p>
            <p>
                Another central concept in FAST is the idea that, rather than explicitly defining the order in which screens are shown to the user in a gadget,
                the order is determined automatically. This happens through the use of <strong>pre-conditions</strong> and <strong>post-conditions</strong>:
                a screen will only show up once all its pre-conditions are fulfilled, and it will produce post-conditions for other screens once the user is
                done with it. This idea is extended from screens to other kinds of building blocks in FAST, to determine the general flow of data.
                The figure below illustrates how the different kinds of building blocks relate to the concepts of pre- and post-conditions. While all 
                building blocks can essentially have such conditions, only screens and screen flows directly aggregate both. However, in the case of the three
                different kinds of screen components (<strong>form</strong>, <strong>resource</strong> and <strong>operator</strong>), the relation to a 
                pre-condition is only established through their actions, which represent their basic functionality. For all building blocks, both 
                pre- and post-conditions are entirely optional.
            </p>
