  title = {Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1},
  abstract = {The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
	for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It
	is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks
	beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed
	object management systems, through extension of its request methods,
	error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and
	negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
	independently of the data being transferred.
	
	
	HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative
	since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as
	"HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].},
