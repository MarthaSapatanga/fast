	Abstract = {The transfer of the mashup paradigm in corporate environments needs additional capabilities beyond those typically associated with consumer mashups. In this paper, we present the architecture of the FAST platform which allows creating enterprise-class and multi-channel visual building blocks (so called gadgets) in an ad-hoc manner. The design of complex enterprise-class gadgets is supported by an integrated semantic concept which hides the complexity from the actual users. The architectural components of the platform, a technical life cycle model for enterprise mashups, and the FAST gadget ontology are presented. By means of a cross-organizational real-world scenario from the marketing/ promotion event area, we demonstrate the value and potential of the FAST platform.},

	Abstract = {The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting
structured data on the Web. These best practices have been adopted by an increasing
number of data providers over the last three years, leading to the creation of a global data
space containing billions of assertions - the Web of Data. In this article we present the
concept and technical principles of Linked Data, and situate these within the broader context
of related technological developments. We describe progress to date in publishing Linked
Data on the Web, review applications that have been developed to exploit the Web of Data,
and map out a research agenda for the Linked Data community as it moves forward.},

@electronic{http1.1,
	Abstract = {{The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)} is an application-level protocol
	for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It
	is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks
	beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed
	object management systems, through extension of its request methods,
	error codes and headers [47]. A feature of {HTTP} is the typing and
	negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
	independently of the data being transferred.
	{HTTP} has been in use by the {World-Wide Web} global information initiative
	since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as
	"{HTTP}/1.1", and is an update to {RFC} 2068 [33].},
