Observations for Author
The paper presents an approach to facilitate the discovery and consumption of business web services by end-users, closing the gap between the two. The paper is an detailed overview of the issue web service wrappers, the experiences with a proposed technology but no theoretical base for it, no funadamental research results, excellent new technology, Is not clear what next steps in the future

Observations for Author
The paper claims to facilitate a more user-friendly platform for discovery and consumption (i.e. deployment/enactment) of Web services. The paper is not convincing that this goal is accomplished successfully. Instead of focusing on a clear direction for improving usability of web services, it uses various paradigms (e.g. visualization, querying end-point, wrapper etc.) in a piece meal fashion. Evaluation and testing sections are also missing.

Observations for Author
The authors propose a platform that aims to facilitate the end-users of web services in discovery and consumption operations. They introduce both a technique to create visually a service wrapper and a repository that can be used in the service discovery process. In my opinion the paper faces a relevant problem in literature, but it seems quite unclear in some points. First of all it lacks of a clear explanation of the whole process that involves service wrapping, publishing, discovery and consumption. I can't understand clearly what is the role of end-users in service wrapping, discovery, etc. There are many concepts without a clear definition, mainly in the description of the FAST platform. In the conceptual model in section 4.1 seems that there are no differences between inputs and preconditions (and also between outputs and postconditions), but in literature (e.g. WSMO) there is a clear distinction. The use case also does not help the reader to understand the information flows inside the proposed platform, and moreover it lacks of a comparative analysis for example for the proposed discovery algorithm. Finally, the figures about UI are quite unreadable.
